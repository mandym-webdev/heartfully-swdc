##Project Summary

Build love where it's needed most.

Creating charitable wedding registries that share your happily ever after with the world.

##My Role

I was lead developer for this project, with a few people who assisted on day 1.

##Technology Used

I know the tech cofounder is building the full-scale app on Rails with a Backbone framework and was hoping for a design which he would be able to implement after the weekend.  For this reason I built the demo with a similar setup so that it would be portable.

##Challenges

Aside from time (we had 2 working days) there were 2 major challenges with this project:

1 - Towards the end of day 1, based on feedback from Startup mentors, we added some functionality that required custom logic to be written.  Given time constraints, we didn't have the opportunity to develop that logic so we had to switch the app content from mostly database driven to mostly static which made the rails app side a bit redundant as it would have been easier to build the app as standard HTML.

2 - On day 2, I was the only developer who showed up.  This was problematic because another group member had generated the initial rails repo and done the push to Heroku so I now had limited control of the repo and no control of Heroku.  As a result, I downloaded the intial app and recreated it and created a new Heroku so I had complete control.  This also required me to do a LOT of CSS which is not my strong suit and given multiple people had been writing CSS, it is not at all dry and could really use some consolidation and optimization with SASS.

##Summary

It was a fantastic experience and I really enjoyed working on the project and am proud of what we accomplished in such a short period of time.
